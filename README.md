# Track-Whose-Been-A-Bad-Employee

## Description

This application allows the user to manage their employee list. A list of functions include being able to add employee, delete employee, update employee role, view all employees, add role, delete role, view all roles, add department, delete department, and view all departments. This complex application allowed me to become familiar with the use of the inquirer prompt and response command, mysql databases, table joining, async/await functions and foreign/primary keys.

## Credits

I referenced many classroom activities to familiarize myself with the user of mysql databases, table joining, async/await functions and foreign/primary keys. I also used google to research many concepts such as console.table and details about table joining.
